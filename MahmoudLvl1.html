    <h1><mark><em>What is freeCodeCamp?</em></mark></h1>
        <p><strong>freeCodeCamp</strong> is a community of millions of people around the world who are learning to code
        together. You can
        learn to code with free online courses, programming projects, and interview preparation for developer jobs.
        We're a 501(c)(3) public charity.</p>
    <h1><mark><em>Is freeCodeCamp a coding bootcamp?</em></mark></h1>
        <p>No. A lot of coding bootcamps use freeCodeCamp as part of their curriculum, though.</p>
    <h1><mark><em>How big is the freeCodeCamp community?</em></mark></h1>
        <p>If you add up all the people who use our learning platform, read our <u>publication</u>, watch our <u>YouTube
            channel</u>, and
        post on <u>our forum</u>, every month we help millions of people learn about coding and technology.</p>
    <h1><mark><em>Can I create apps or tools based around the freeCodeCamp community and platform?</em></mark></h1>
        <p>Yes. freeCodeCamp is open source (BSD-3 license), and most non-sensitive freeCodeCamp data is publicly available.
        But you must make it clear that you don't represent freeCodeCamp itself, and that your project is not officially
        endorsed by freeCodeCamp.</p>
    <h1><mark><em>Does freeCodeCamp have a mobile app?</em></mark></h1>
        <p>We are building a fully-featured Android app. In the meantime, you can learn on the go by watching freeCodeCamp's
        YouTube channel. And if you want a mobile app designed specifically for learning to code, we recommend
        Grasshopper. It's free and designed by a freeCodeCamp contributor and her team. You can download it on iOS or
        Android.</p>
